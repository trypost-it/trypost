# Scheduling Posts

TryPost makes it easy to schedule your social media content in advance.

## Creating a Scheduled Post

1. Click **Create Post** or click on a date in the calendar
2. Write your content
3. Add media (images or videos) if desired
4. Select the accounts you want to post to
5. Choose the date and time
6. Click **Schedule**

## The Calendar View

The calendar shows all your scheduled posts:

- **Drag and drop** posts to reschedule them
- **Click** on a post to view, edit, or delete it
- **Filter** by account or status
- **Switch views** between month, week, or day

## Post Status

Posts can have the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Draft** | Saved but not scheduled |
| **Scheduled** | Waiting to be published |
| **Publishing** | Currently being sent to platforms |
| **Published** | Successfully posted |
| **Failed** | Failed to publish (check error details) |

## Multi-Platform Posting

You can post to multiple platforms at once:

1. Select multiple accounts when creating a post
2. TryPost will adapt the content for each platform
3. Each platform's post is tracked separately

## Best Times to Post

Consider your audience's timezone and activity patterns when scheduling. General guidelines:

- **LinkedIn**: Tuesday-Thursday, 9am-12pm
- **X/Twitter**: Weekdays, 8am-10am and 6pm-9pm
- **Instagram**: Monday-Friday, 11am-1pm and 7pm-9pm
- **Facebook**: Wednesday-Friday, 1pm-4pm

## Queue (Coming Soon)

Future versions will support a post queue where you can add content and let TryPost automatically schedule it at optimal times.
