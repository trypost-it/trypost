# Workspaces

Workspaces help you organize your social media accounts, especially if you manage multiple brands or clients.

## What is a Workspace?

A workspace is a container that holds:

- Social media accounts
- Scheduled posts
- Team members
- Settings

Each workspace is completely separate from others.

## Creating a Workspace

1. Click on your current workspace name in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Workspace**
3. Enter a name for the workspace
4. Click **Create**

## Switching Workspaces

Click on the workspace name in the sidebar to see all your workspaces and switch between them.

## Use Cases

### Agencies

Create a workspace for each client:

- Client A Workspace (their social accounts)
- Client B Workspace (their social accounts)
- Your Agency Workspace (your own accounts)

### Multiple Brands

If you manage multiple brands:

- Brand A Workspace
- Brand B Workspace

### Personal vs Business

Separate your personal and business presence:

- Personal Workspace
- Business Workspace

## Workspace Settings

Each workspace has its own settings:

- **Name** - The workspace display name
- **Members** - Who has access (see [Team Management](team.md))
- **Connected Accounts** - Social media accounts in this workspace

## Deleting a Workspace

1. Go to **Settings** > **Workspace**
2. Scroll to the danger zone
3. Click **Delete Workspace**

> **Warning:** This will delete all posts and disconnect all accounts in the workspace. This action cannot be undone.
