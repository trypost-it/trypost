# Mastodon

Connect your Mastodon account to TryPost.

## How It Works

Mastodon is a decentralized network with many instances (servers). TryPost automatically registers an OAuth app with your instance when you connect.

## No Global Configuration Required

Unlike other platforms, you don't need to configure environment variables for Mastodon. Each user connects to their own instance.

## Connect Your Account

1. In TryPost, go to **Accounts**
2. Click **Connect Mastodon**
3. Enter your Mastodon instance URL (e.g., `mastodon.social`, `fosstodon.org`)
4. Click **Authorize**
5. Log in to your Mastodon instance and authorize TryPost
6. You're ready to post!

Character limits vary by instance. Most use the default 500 characters, but some instances allow more.
